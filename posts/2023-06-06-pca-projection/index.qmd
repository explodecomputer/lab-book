## Background

Need to be able to calculate genetic principal components in unrelateds and then project into relateds.

Simulate

```{r}
library(MASS)
m <- 20
A <- matrix(runif(m^2)*2-1, ncol=m)
sigma <- t(A) %*% A
gen <- mvrnorm(1000, rep(0, m), sigma)
```

Generate in full sample

```{r}
pcafull <- princomp(gen)
names(pcafull)
```


Generate in 90%

```{r}
pca90 <- princomp(gen[1:900,])
```

Project into remaining 10%

```{r}
pca10 <- gen[901:1000,] %*% pca90$loadings
```

correlate full with projected

```{r}
diag(cor(pca10, pcafull$scores[901:1000,]))
```

This works fine. Looks like GCTA does something similar here: https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#PCloadingandprojection

```{r}
sessionInfo()
