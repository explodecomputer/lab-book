## Background

Liza's analysis of BMI instruments clusters them by PheWAS and finds that cluster 4 relates to SES, and drives BMI-EDU biased effect. Are the instruments in cluster 4 solely due to dynastic confounding? If so they should fail to replicate in the sibling analysis.

## Instruments

```{r}
library(ieugwasr)
library(dplyr)

Extract instruments from the population and sibling GWASs

```{r}
wfest <- ieugwasr::associations(unlist(bmi_inst), "ieu-b-4815")
popest <- ieugwasr::associations(unlist(bmi_inst), "ieu-b-4816")
giantest <- ieugwasr::associations(unlist(bmi_inst), "ieu-b-40")
ukbest <- ieugwasr::associations(unlist(bmi_inst), "ukb-b-19953")
```

Replication rates function

```{r}
exp_rep <- function(b_disc, b_rep, se_disc, se_rep, alpha)
{
  p_sign <- pnorm(-abs(b_disc) / se_disc) * pnorm(-abs(b_disc) / se_rep) + ((1 - pnorm(-abs(b_disc) / se_disc)) * (1 - pnorm(-abs(b_disc) / se_rep)))
  p_sig <- pnorm(-abs(b_disc) / se_rep + qnorm(alpha / 2)) + (1 - pnorm(-abs(b_disc) / se_rep - qnorm(alpha / 2)))
  p_rep <- pnorm(abs(b_rep)/se_rep, lower.tail=FALSE)
  res <- tibble::tibble(
    nsnp=length(b_disc),
    metric=c("Sign", "Sign", "P-value", "P-value"),
    datum=c("Expected", "Observed", "Expected", "Observed"),
    value=c(sum(p_sign, na.rm=TRUE), sum(sign(b_disc) == sign(b_rep)), sum(p_sig, na.rm=TRUE), sum(p_rep < alpha, na.rm=TRUE))
  )
  return(list(res=res, variants=dplyr::tibble(sig=p_sig, sign=p_sign)))
}
```

Analysis

```{r}
ests <- bind_rows(giantest, wfest, popest, ukbest) %>%
  mutate(cluster=NA)
for(i in 1:length(bmi_inst))
{
  ests$cluster[ests$rsid %in% bmi_inst[[i]]] <- i
}

ests %>%
  group_by(id, cluster) %>%
  summarise(n=n(), psig = sum(p < 5e-3)/n) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=as.factor(cluster), y=psig)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity", aes(fill=id))
```

Expected vs observed replication rates

```{r}
o <- lapply(1:length(bmi_inst), function(i)
{
  x <- bmi_inst[[i]]
  dat <- inner_join(
    subset(popest, rsid %in% x),
    subset(wfest, rsid %in% x),
    by="rsid"
  )
  exp_rep(dat$beta.x, dat$beta.y, dat$se.x, dat$se.y, 1e-3)[[1]] %>%
    mutate(cluster=i)
})
o %>% bind_rows() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(cluster), y=value/nsnp)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=datum)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ metric) +
  labs(x="Cluster", y="Fraction of sig. instruments", colour="")
```

## Summary

All clusters appear to replicate as expected in the within-family GWAS, which is consistent with there being almost no shrinkage of the effect sizes.

## Childhood vs adulthood relationship to SES

```{r}
library(TwoSampleMR)
child <- make_dat("ukb-b-10011", "ebi-a-GCST90002409")
mr(child) %>% select(nsnp, b, se, pval)

```

```{r}
adult <- make_dat("ukb-b-10011", "ukb-b-19953")
mr(adult) %>% select(nsnp, b, se, pval)
```

Replication of clustered instruments from adult to child

```{r}
ukbest <- ieugwasr::associations(unlist(bmi_inst), "ukb-b-19953")
childest <- ieugwasr::associations(unlist(bmi_inst), "ebi-a-GCST90002409")
```

```{r}
o1 <- lapply(1:length(bmi_inst), function(i)
{
  x <- bmi_inst[[i]]
  dat <- inner_join(
    subset(ukbest, rsid %in% x),
    subset(childest, rsid %in% x),
    by="rsid"
  )
  exp_rep(dat$beta.x, dat$beta.y, dat$se.x, dat$se.y, 1e-3)[[1]] %>%
    mutate(cluster=i)
})
o1 %>% bind_rows() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(cluster), y=value/nsnp)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=datum)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ metric) +
  labs(x="Cluster", y="Fraction of sig. instruments", colour="")

```

### Summary

-   SES has an influence on BMI in adulthood but not childhood

-   The replication rate amongst clusters appears to be relatively consistent, except cluster 2 replicates particularly well
