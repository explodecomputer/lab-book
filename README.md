# Lab book

I use this place to keep track of miscellaneous code and documents. It's always rough work, unpolished, potentially full of errors.

## To generate

Downlaod the [quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), then run

```bash
quarto render
```

or to view a local version of the website with realtime updates

```bash
quarto preview
```
